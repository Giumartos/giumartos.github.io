								<b>Education:</b>
							</p>
							I have a bachelor degree (2022) and a MSc (2025) in Astronomy, both from the University of São Paulo, Brazil, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Jorge Meléndez. During my bachelor,
							I did an internship at Space Telescope Science Institute, under supervision of Dr. Nestor Espinoza, studying the radial velocity method for the detection of exoplanets.. In my MSc,
							I worked with Dr. Lorenzo Spina and Dr. Sara Lucatello at Padova Observatory, building Neural Network to obtain chemical abundances and atmospheric parameters of solar-type stars. Currently I am a PhD student
							at Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (Heidelberg, Germany), working under supervision of Dr. Laura Kreidberg in the characterization of warm giant exoplanets.
							<p>


								<b>Research Interests:</b>
							</p> I am interested in the characterization of exoplanets, more e specifically warm giants, and how its mass and bulk metallicity are related to formation mechanisms and stellar type.
							I am also interested in the chemical composition of solar type stars and the effect of the presence of planets on its chemical abundances.

								<b> The mass-bulk metallicity relation for gas giant planets</b><br>

								Bulk metallicity is a fundamental property of gas giant exoplanets, key to constraining models of planetary formation and evolution.
								Metal enrichment can be inferred based on mass and radius measurements alone, thanks to the higher densities expected for more metal-rich compositions.
								Several previous studies of warm giants found a relationship between bulk metallicity and planet mass, consistent with the core accretion model for
								planet formation. However, these results are based on an inhomogeneous data set with a range of assumptions about the stellar (and thus planetary) parameters.
								In this work, we revisit the mass-bulk metallicity trend, with a larger sample of planets and improved precision and accuracy for the stellar masses and radii.
								We combine SED fitting, GAIA DR3 parallaxes, and uniform modeling of the transits and radial velocity measurements using archival data. With updated planet masses
								and radii, we use the interior structure code GASTLI to infer the metal enrichment of the planets. The improved precision and larger sample enable a test of the
								intrinsic scatter in the mass-bulk metallicity relation, as well as a search for trends in metal enrichment as a function of stellar type.


								<br><br><b>Metallicity and age effects on lithium depletion in solar analogs</b><br>

								Lithium is a fragile element, that is destroyed at relatively low temperatures in the interior of stars.
								The lithium present in the photospheres of solar-type stars is transported to the inner parts by convection, reaching regions even somewhat below the convection zone, by non-standard
								transport mechanisms. In stars with deeper convective zones, this element can reach regions with temperatures sufficient enough to be destroyed, implying in a lower Li content. In this work,
								we intended to verify the prediction that more metallic stars are depleted in lithium, due to the deepening of their convective zones. We also investigated the impact of planets lithium. We
								found robust anticorrelations between lithium abundance and both metallicity and age, with a significance above 10σ in both cases. Our results agree qualitatively with theoretical predictions
								and are useful to constrain non-standard models of Li depletion, and to better understand transport and mixing mechanisms inside stars.
