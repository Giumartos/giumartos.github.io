								<b> The mass-bulk metallicity relation for gas giant planets (in progress)</b>

								<p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">Giulia Martos and Laura Kreiberg</p>

								Bulk metallicity is a fundamental property of gas giant exoplanets, key to constraining models of planetary formation and evolution.
								Metal enrichment can be inferred based on mass and radius measurements alone, thanks to the higher densities expected for more metal-rich compositions.
								Several previous studies of warm giants found a relationship between bulk metallicity and planet mass, consistent with the core accretion model for
								planet formation. However, these results are based on an inhomogeneous data set with a range of assumptions about the stellar (and thus planetary) parameters.
								In this work, we revisit the mass-bulk metallicity trend, with a larger sample of planets and improved precision and accuracy for the stellar masses and radii.
								We combine SED fitting, GAIA DR3 parallaxes, and uniform modeling of the transits and radial velocity measurements using archival data. With updated planet masses
								and radii, we use the interior structure code GASTLI to infer the metal enrichment of the planets. These precise and robust measurements of metal enrichment for will enable:
								(1) quantitative tests of predictions from planet formation models, (2) investigation of trends in metal enrichment with system parameters like stellar type and planet multiplicity, and
							(3) a benchmark for comparison with upcoming atmospheric metallicity measurements for warm giants from JWST.

								<br><b>Signatures of planets and Galactic subpopulations in solar analogs</b>

								<p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">Giulia Martos, Jorge Meléndez, Lorenzo Spina, and Sara Lucatello</p>

								Precise chemical abundances are key for the characterization of planet hosts, since the formation and the presence of planets around the stars can alter their chemical composition, leaving
								chemical fingerprints that can be revealed via detailed analyses of the spectrum. In this work, we obtained precise atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances automatically using neural networks for 99 solar twins and
								solar analogs to find signatures of exoplanets, as well as to assess how peculiar the Sun is compared to these stars and to analyze any possible fine structures in the Galactic thin disk.
								The results we obtained are in line with the literature, with average differences and standard deviations of (2 ± 27) K for Teff , (0.00 ± 0.06) dex for log g, (0.00 ± 0.02) dex for [Fe/H], (−0.01 ± 0.05) km s−1 for
								microturbulence velocity (vt ), (0.02 ± 0.08) km s−1 for the macro turbulence velocity (vmacro), and (−0.12 ± 0.26) km s−1 for the projected rotational velocity (vsini). Regarding the chemical abundances,
								most of the elements agree with the literature within 0.01 - 0.02 dex. We found that the Sun is more depleted in refractory elements compared to volatiles than 89% of the studied solar analogs,
								with a significance of 9.5σ when compared to the stars without detected exoplanets. We also found the possible presence of three subpopulations in the solar analogs: one Cu-rich, one Cu-poor,
								and the last one being slightly older and poor in Na.<br><br>

							<br><br><b>Metallicity and age effects on lithium depletion in solar analogs</b><br><br>

								<p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">Giulia Martos, Jorge Meléndez, Anne Rathsam and Gabriela Carvalho-Silva</p>

								Lithium is a fragile element, that is destroyed at relatively low temperatures in the interior of stars.
								The lithium present in the photospheres of solar-type stars is transported to the inner parts by convection, reaching regions even somewhat below the convection zone, by non-standard
								transport mechanisms. In stars with deeper convective zones, this element can reach regions with temperatures sufficient enough to be destroyed, implying in a lower Li content. In this work,
								we intended to verify the prediction that more metallic stars are depleted in lithium, due to the deepening of their convective zones. We also investigated the impact of planets lithium. We
								found robust anticorrelations between lithium abundance and both metallicity and age, with a significance above 10σ in both cases. Our results agree qualitatively with theoretical predictions
								and are useful to constrain non-standard models of Li depletion, and to better understand transport and mixing mechanisms inside stars.
